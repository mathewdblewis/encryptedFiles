PLAN:
Pass the secret key to the html (maybe via a popup?) then use this to decrypt the content that is loaded from github
alternatively extract the key from the URL
This could be more convenient in that you can now send people links that don't require a signin step

NOTE: you can't do this using htmlpreview.github.io because the url is already a parameter
